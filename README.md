## ⚡ Kit Maintenance (How to Sync & Update)

> **Read this first if you need to update agents, add skills, or migrate to a new AI tool.**

This kit follows a **one-way sync model**:

```
.claude/agents/   ←── SOURCE OF TRUTH ──→  .claude/skills/
        │                                         │
        ▼  .\scripts\sync-to-antigravity.ps1      ▼
_agents/workflows/   (Antigravity)           skills/   (Antigravity)
```

### Rules
- ✅ **Edit** only `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/`
- ✅ **Run sync** after any change
- ❌ **Never edit** `_agents/workflows/` or `skills/` directly — they are auto-generated

### Sync Commands (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# Full sync (agents + skills + regenerate skill-index.json)
.\scripts\sync-to-antigravity.ps1

# Preview without writing
.\scripts\sync-to-antigravity.ps1 -DryRun

# Agents only
.\scripts\sync-to-antigravity.ps1 -AgentsOnly

# Skills only
.\scripts\sync-to-antigravity.ps1 -SkillsOnly
```

### Sync to Codex (Copilot)
This kit also includes an out-of-the-box sync script for GitHub Copilot/Codex formats:

```powershell
# Sync to .github/agents/ and .github/copilot-instructions.md
.\scripts\sync-to-codex.ps1

# Dry run
.\scripts\sync-to-codex.ps1 -DryRun
```

*Note: Edit variables at the top of `scripts/sync-to-codex.ps1` (like `$CodexAgentTarget`) before running if the official Codex target directory format changes.*

# tri-ai-kit

Multi-agent development toolkit providing skills, agents, and workflows for Claude Code, Antigravity, and Codex. Specialized agents handle each phase of the software lifecycle — from problem definition to post-launch monitoring.

## Setup Instructions

Depending on the AI tool you are using, follow the specific setup guide below:

- **Claude Code:** [Claude Setup Instructions](./claude-setup-instructions.md)
- **Antigravity:** [Antigravity Setup & Architecture](./ANTIGRAVITY.md)
- **Codex (GitHub Copilot):** [Codex Setup Instructions](./codex-setup-instructions.md)

> See [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for the full 15-phase production delivery workflow.

## What It Is

tri-ai-kit installs a set of agents, skills, and hooks/workflows into your AI workspace. The main conversation acts as the orchestrator — it reads context, routes to the right agent, and merges results. Agents do not spawn other agents.

> **Ecosystem Behavior**: Depending on the Agentic AI platform you are using, the toolkit adapts its form factor. It will appropriately leverage **skills**, **workflows**, or **custom agents** to fit the platform. Specifically, Claude Code and GitHub Copilot use the custom agents and routing logic natively, while Antigravity and Codex utilize them as standalone workflows.

**Core loop:**
```
/brainstorm → /plan → /cook → /review → /test → /git
```

---

## Agents

*Note: The custom agents defined below operate as conversational entities in Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, but function as structured workflows in Antigravity and Codex.*

### Planning & Coordination
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `planner` | Creates phased implementation plans; orchestrates backend/frontend architects for fullstack features |
| `backend-architect` | API contracts, data models, service boundaries, auth strategy, DB schema |
| `frontend-architect` | Page/screen structure, routing hierarchy, component architecture, state management |
| `researcher` | Technical research, best practices, technology comparison |
| `brainstormer` | Problem definition, approach evaluation, tradeoff analysis |
| `project-manager` | Progress tracking, roadmap updates, milestone documentation |

### Implementation
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `developer` | Fullstack dispatcher — routes to frontend/backend specialist based on task scope |
| `frontend-developer` | React, Next.js, TanStack Start, TypeScript UI, state management, E2E testing, UI/UX design, design systems |
| `backend-developer` | Go, Node.js, Python/FastAPI, REST/GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL, microservices, authentication |
| `devops-engineer` | Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, cloud deployments, observability |
| `design-specialist` | Brand identity, logo design, design systems, design tokens, UI/UX mockups, banners, social media assets, pitch decks |

## Workflows (Antigravity & Codex)

In Antigravity and Codex, the capabilities of the agents listed above are packaged and exported as standalone **Workflows**. These workflows are generated into their respective platform folders (e.g., `_agents/workflows/` for Antigravity) during the sync process.

### Triggering Workflows in Antigravity

Antigravity natively tracks and references the generated `.md` workflow files. A workflow is executed in Antigravity via two primary methods:

1. **Slash Commands**: You can explicitly trigger any workflow by typing a slash command matching the file's name. For example, typing `/code-reviewer` or `/devops-engineer` will instruct Antigravity to fetch the exact workflow logic from `_agents/workflows/code-reviewer.md`.
2. **Autonomous Triggers**: The underlying Antigravity system prompt has built-in awareness of the workflows directory. When a user prompt matches the description of an existing workflow, Antigravity can autonomously choose to read the corresponding `.md` workflow file to ensure structured execution.

> 💡 **Important Setup Note:** To ensure Antigravity fully understands your routing logic, agent intents, and architecture boundaries, you **must** load the instructions defined in `ANTIGRAVITY.md` into your Antigravity System Prompt (User Rules/Instructions). Make sure your environment is configured to read this file!

## Hooks

*Note: Hooks are lifecycle scripts currently specific to Claude Code sessions.*

The toolkit ships hooks that run automatically during Claude Code sessions:

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Session Init** | Loads project context, detects platform, checks active plans |
| **Scout Block** | Prevents overly broad file scans that waste context |
| **Privacy Block** | Blocks accidental reads of `.env` and credential files |
| **Build Gate** | Verifies build passes before marking work complete |
| **Notifications** | Sends Discord/Slack/Telegram alerts on session events |

---

## Routing Logic

*Note: This conversational routing logic is dictated by the `AGENTS.md` instructions for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. For Antigravity and Codex, tasks are bound directly to workflows.*

The orchestrator classifies every prompt before acting:

| Intent | Examples | Routes To |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Build / Create (frontend) | "add a button", "build a form", "React component" | `frontend-developer` |
| Build / Create (backend) | "add an endpoint", "write a migration", "REST API" | `backend-developer` |
| Build / Create (generic) | "implement X", "continue the plan" | `developer` |
| Architecture (backend) | "design the API", "data model", "auth strategy" | `backend-architect` |
| Architecture (frontend) | "routing structure", "component hierarchy" | `frontend-architect` |
| Fix / Debug | "this crashes", "why does X fail" | `debugger` |
| Plan / Design | "how should we build X", "let's plan" | `planner` |
| Research | "best practices for", "compare A vs B" | `researcher` |
| Review / Audit | "check my code", "review before merge" | `code-reviewer` |
| Security | "security audit", "harden this", "OWASP" | `security-auditor` |
| Infra / CI/CD | "set up CI/CD", "deploy this", "Docker", "Terraform" | `devops-engineer` |
| UI / Design System | "audit this component", "design tokens" | `muji` |
| UI/UX Design | "design a page", "create a brand", "logo", "banner", "color palette" | `design-specialist` |
| Accessibility | "WCAG audit", "screen reader", "a11y" | `a11y-specialist` |
| Test | "add tests", "validate this works" | `tester` |
| Docs | "document this", "update the docs" | `docs-manager` |
| Git | "commit", "push", "create a PR" | `git-manager` |

---

## Output Style Levels

Configure verbosity by referencing output style levels:

| Level | Style |
|-------|-------|
| 0 — ELI5 | Plain language, no jargon |
| 1 — Junior | Step-by-step with explanations |
| 2 — Mid | Balanced detail |
| 3 — Senior | Terse, pattern-focused |
| 4 — Lead | Architecture and trade-offs only |
| 5 — God | Maximum density, no hand-holding |

---

## Notifications Setup

Configure delivery channels in `.claude/hooks/notifications/.env`:

```bash
# Discord
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...

# Slack
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...

# Telegram
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
